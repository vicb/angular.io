  Defines route lifecycle method [canDeactivate], which is called by the router to determine
  if a component can be removed as part of a navigation.
  
  If `canDeactivate` returns or resolves to `false`, the navigation is cancelled.
  
  If `canDeactivate` throws or rejects, the navigation is also cancelled.
  
  ## Example
  ```
  @Directive({
    selector: 'my-cmp'
  })
  class MyCmp implements CanDeactivate {
    canDeactivate(next, prev) {
      return askUserIfTheyAreSureTheyWantToQuit();
    }
  }
   ```
